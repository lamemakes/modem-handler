# Modem Handler

ðŸš§ This is currently a proof of concept and is **not stable** ðŸš§

The modem handler is a service that is intended to act as a wrapper for GSM Modems.

While it was built around the SIM7600 modem, it is should theoretically work with most GSM modems that utilize the [Hayes command set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_AT_command_set)


## Before building

For dbus to work, `libdbus-glib-1-dev` is required:

```
sudo apt install libdbus-glib-1-dev
```
